**Representational State Transfer (REST)** is a software architectural style that provides guidelines on how an API should work. It was created as a guideline to manage communication on a complex network like the Internet. REST is a set of principles and constraints that, when followed, enable the creation of scalable, efficient, and maintainable web services.

**RESTful APIs,** or **REST APIs,** are APIs that follow the REST architectural style for designing and interacting with web services. Aside from using the APIs to communicate and share data between two or more software or applications, RESTful APIs contribute to the efficiency, scalability, and flexibility of web applications, playing a major role in web development. Other benefits of RESTful APIs in the aspect of web development are statelessness, compatibility and interoperability, simplified integration, improved security, and simplicity.

Two major concepts that are central to understanding how RESTful APIs work are: Endpoints and Resources

* **RESOURCES:** Resources are any information that can be identified, named, and manipulated. They are the key abstractions that are exposed via the API.
    
* **ENDPOINT:** An endpoint is the access point or the specific URL(Uniform Resource Locator) or URI that represents a resource or a collection of resources through which clients can interact with the API.

## Key Principles of RESTful Architecture

The main principles of RESTful architecture, also known as REST constraints, collectively define RESTful architecture and guide the design of web services that adhere to these constraints. The principles include:

* **STATELESSNESS:** Every request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. Statelessness enhances scalability and simplifies server implementation.
    
* **UNIFORM INTERFACE:** Sub-constraints like resource identification by URL, Resource manipulation by representation, self-descriptive message, and interaction of clients with applications solely through hypermedia commonly known as HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) enable for uniform and consistent interface.
    
* **CLIENT-SERVER ARCHITECTURE:** RESTful systems follow a structure where the client and server are separate entities that communicate over a network. The client is responsible for the user interface and user experience, while the server is responsible for processing requests, managing resources, and maintaining the application's business logic. This separation of concerns enhances scalability and flexibility.
    
* **LAYERED SYSTEM:** There are multiple layers with each layer having its specific functionality consisting in REST architecture. Each layer interacts with the adjacent layer to promote modularity and scalability.
    
* **CODE ON DEMAND:** This principle provides a way for client applications to load and execute provided by the server, enhancing the client's capabilities. Even though "Code on Demand" can provide flexibility, it's not always suitable for all scenarios due to security considerations and the potential for increased coupling between the client and server. The decision to use "Code on Demand" depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the application being developed.
    
* **CACHEABILITY:** Cacheability improves performance by allowing clients to reuse previously fetched representations, reducing the need for repeated requests to the server.

## Endpoints in RESTful APIs

**Endpoints** define the functionality or actions performed on resources, such as retrieving a list of items, creating a new item, updating an existing item, or deleting an item. RESTful APIs often have multiple endpoints to perform different operations on the same resource or to work with different resources.

Endpoints play a major role in the design of APIs by serving as access points through which clients interact with the API. Some of the important endpoints in API design are:

* **Resource exposure:** Endpoints define the resources or collection of resources exposed by the API, and each endpoint defines a specific resource or set of resources, making it clear which resource or set of resources a client can interact with.
    
* **Operation Definition:** Endpoints specify the action that clients can perform on resources. [HTTP methods](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-http/) like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE are used to define the action.
    
* **Modularity and Scalability:** Endpoints promote modularity by summarizing specific functionalities related to a specific resource or set of resources. Modularity enhances the maintainability of the API and allows for scalable development.
    
* **Clear and Intuitive Design:** By choosing meaningful and consistent naming conventions for endpoints, developers can easily understand the purpose and functionality of each endpoint, which contributes to the clarity and intuitive design of the API.
    

There are different types of endpoints categorized based on their functionality and the types of operations they support. Some of the different types are:

* **Read and Retrieval Endpoints:** used to retrieve resources from the server using the HTTP GET method.
    
* **Create or POST Endpoints:** used to create new resources on the server using the HTTP POST method
    
* **Delete Endpoints:** used to delete a resource on the server using the HTTP DELETE method
    
* **Update or PUT Endpoints:** used to update existing resources on the server using the HTTP PUT method.
    
* **Search or Query Endpoints:** Allows clients to retrieve a subset of resources based on specified criteria using the HTTP GET method.
    
* **List Endpoints:** Retrieves a collection or list of resources using the HTTP GET method.
    

## Resources in RESTful APIs

**Resources** are key abstraction that represents any information that can be identified, named and manipulated. Examples of resources include user profiles, articles, and any other data entity that applications deal with. Resources can be identified by a distinct URI (Uniform Resource Identifier). They are usually in [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) or [XML](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/xml/#:~:text=Extensible%20Markup%20Language%20(XML)%20is,implemented%20for%20structured%20data%20management.) formats, and each resource can be created, retrieved, updated, and deleted using standard HTTP methods.

The foundation of building a RESTful architecture is identifying its resources. Some of the major guidelines for identifying resources in API design include:

* **Use Nouns for Resource Names:** instead of using verbs like "get" or "retrieve" in the resource name, use nouns like "users" or "products."
    
* **Resource Naming Conventions:** Follow a consistent naming convention for resources. Names that are easy to understand and remember should be used.
    
* **Use Plural Nouns for Collections of Resources:** For example '/users' is a collection of user resources and '/products' is a collection of product resources.
    
* **Documentation:** APIs should be clearly documented to enable users understand available resources and how to interact with them.
    

## Relationship between Resources and Endpoints

The relationship between resources and endpoints is fundamental to the design and functionality of a RESTful API. Some of the relationships between them are:

* **Endpoints as Access Points:** An endpoint is the specific URI or URL that corresponds to a resource or a collection of resources. It provides a concrete access point through which clients can interact with the resource.
    
* **Endpoint identifies a Resource:** The endpoint identifies a resource or set of resources. For example, if you have a resource representing users, the endpoint might be '/users.
    
* **HTTP Methods defines Operations:** Endpoints are associated with specific HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), which define the operations that can be performed on the corresponding resource.
    
* **Resource Representation:** Endpoint exchanges representations of the resource with the server when client interacts with it. These representations can be in different formats like JSON or XML and contain the state or information about the resource. The representation is the payload of the HTTP request or response.
    
* **Uniform Interface:** The relationship between resources and endpoints adheres to the uniform interface constraints of REST. The combination of resources and endpoints creates a consistent and predictable API structure.
    
* **HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State):** It involves including hypermedia links in the resource representations, allowing clients to navigate the API dynamically.
    

### Conclusion

The interaction between resources and endpoints is critical in RESTful API design for developing a unified and efficient architecture. Resources, which represent conceptual entities, define the system's essential entities, such as users or products. Endpoints, represented by URIs, serve as gateways for clients to interact with these resources via specified HTTP methods. Following the RESTful principles, this symbiotic relationship ensures a uniform interface, self-descriptive communication, and dynamic navigation via hypermedia links (HATEOAS). The careful alignment of resources and endpoints is more than a technical detail; it is a design concept that drives the API's clarity, scalability, and adaptability, resulting in a seamless and intuitive experience for developers and users alike.
